# Assembly_Calculator
 The calculator is created by using assembly code  for 8086 system. To develop and test the program we used a emulated  system (emu8086). The program will ask for the requested operation first  then use the decision-making section made by Jump instruction to do the  required Operation. Then it will ask for the two-digit number which can be  taken as 2 deferred digit and calculated to be a single number. Then we will  use Procedure of assembly language to create the Defer-Operation and make them functional. We will have four operation Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
